abstract: Industrial control systems (ICSs) are facing serious security challenges
  due to their inherent flaws, and emergence of vulnerabilities from the integration
  with commercial components and networks. To that end, assessing the security plays
  a vital role for current industrial enterprises which are responsible for critical
  infrastructure. This paper accomplishes a complex task of quantitative assessment
  based on attack graphs in order to look forward critical paths. For the purpose
  of application to a large-scale heterogeneous ICSs, we propose a flexible attack
  graph generation algorithm is proposed with the help of the graph data model. Hereafter,
  our quantitative assessment takes a consideration of graph indicators on specific
  nodes and edges to get the security metrics. In order to improve results of obtaining
  the critical attack path, we introduced a formulating selection rule, considering
  the asset value of industrial control devices. The experimental results show validation
  and verification of the proposed method.
