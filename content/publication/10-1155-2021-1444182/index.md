abstract: With the convergence of IT and OT networks, more opportunities can be found
  to destroy physical processes by cyberattacks. Discovering attack paths plays a
  vital role in describing possible sequences of exploitation. Automated planning
  that is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) is introduced into the
  attack graph modeling. However, while adopting the modeling method for large-scale
  IT and OT networks, it is difficult to meet urgent demands, such as scattered data
  management, scalability, and automation. To that end, an automatic planning-based
  attack path discovery approach is proposed in this paper. At first, information
  of the attacking knowledge and network topology is formally represented in a standardized
  planning domain definition language (PDDL), integrated into a graph data model.
  Subsequently, device reachability graph partitioning algorithm is introduced to
  obtain subgraphs that are small enough and of limited size, which facilitates the
  discovery of attack paths through the AI planner as soon as possible. In order to
  further cope with scalability problems, a multithreading manner is used to execute
  the attack path enumeration for each subgraph. Finally, an automatic workflow with
  the assistance of a graph database is provided for constructing the PDDL problem
  file for each subgraph and traversal query in an interactive way. A case study is
  presented to demonstrate effectiveness of attack path discovery and efficiency with
  the increase in number of devices.
