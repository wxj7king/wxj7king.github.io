 abstract = {With the convergence of IT and OT networks, more opportunities can be found to destroy physical processes by cyberattacks. Discovering attack paths plays a vital role in describing possible sequences of exploitation. Automated planning that is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) is introduced into the attack graph modeling. However, while adopting the modeling method for large-scale IT and OT networks, it is difficult to meet urgent demands, such as scattered data management, scalability, and automation. To that end, an automatic planning-based attack path discovery approach is proposed in this paper. At first, information of the attacking knowledge and network topology is formally represented in a standardized planning domain definition language (PDDL), integrated into a graph data model. Subsequently, device reachability graph partitioning algorithm is introduced to obtain subgraphs that are small enough and of limited size, which facilitates the discovery of attack paths through the AI planner as soon as possible. In order to further cope with scalability problems, a multithreading manner is used to execute the attack path enumeration for each subgraph. Finally, an automatic workflow with the assistance of a graph database is provided for constructing the PDDL problem file for each subgraph and traversal query in an interactive way. A case study is presented to demonstrate effectiveness of attack path discovery and efficiency with the increase in number of devices.},
