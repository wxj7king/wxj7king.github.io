abstract = {With the convergence of IT and OT networks, more opportunities can be found to destroy physical processes by cyberattacks. Discovering attack paths plays a vital role in describing possible sequences of exploitation. Automated planning that is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) is introduced into the attack graph modeling. However, while adopting the modeling method for large-scale IT and OT networks, it is difficult to meet urgent demands, such as scattered data management, scalability, and automation. To that end, an automatic planning-based attack path discovery approach is proposed in this paper. At first, information of the attacking knowledge and network topology is formally represented in a standardized planning domain definition language (PDDL), integrated into a graph data model. Subsequently, device reachability graph partitioning algorithm is introduced to obtain subgraphs that are small enough and of limited size, which facilitates the discovery of attack paths through the AI planner as soon as possible. In order to further cope with scalability problems, a multithreading manner is used to execute the attack path enumeration for each subgraph. Finally, an automatic workflow with the assistance of a graph database is provided for constructing the PDDL problem file for each subgraph and traversal query in an interactive way. A case study is presented to demonstrate effectiveness of attack path discovery and efficiency with the increase in number of devices.},

  abstract={Industrial control systems (ICSs) are facing serious security challenges due to their inherent flaws, and emergence of vulnerabilities from the integration with commercial components and networks. To that end, assessing the security plays a vital role for current industrial enterprises which are responsible for critical infrastructure. This paper accomplishes a complex task of quantitative assessment based on attack graphs in order to look forward critical paths. For the purpose of application to a large-scale heterogeneous ICSs, we propose a flexible attack graph generation algorithm is proposed with the help of the graph data model. Hereafter, our quantitative assessment takes a consideration of graph indicators on specific nodes and edges to get the security metrics. In order to improve results of obtaining the critical attack path, we introduced a formulating selection rule, considering the asset value of industrial control devices. The experimental results show validation and verification of the proposed method.},
